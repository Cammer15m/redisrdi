In this section, let's take a look at a few transformation examples. For all of the examples, let's assume we are still using the Invoices and InvoiceLineItems tables from earlier.

### Write to a Redis hash

We have already seen this quite a bit in the previous example, but here is another job file to explore: 

```YAML
source:
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: hash
      key:
        expression: concat(['invoice_id:', InvoiceId])
        language: jmespath
```

In this case, the result will be Redis hashes with key names based on the key expression (for example, `invoice_id:1`).

### Write to a Redis JSON document

In the example below, the data is captured from the source table named invoice and is written to the Redis database as a JSON document.

```YAML
source:
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: json
      key:
        expression: concat(['invoice_id:', InvoiceId])
        language: jmespath
      on_update: replace        
```

Here we are again exploring the parameter `on_update` which specifies the writing strategy, but this time with the value of  `replace` (the default) rather than `merge`. The `replace` option is usually more performant, while `merge` allows other jobs and apps to set extra fields in the same JSON documents.

{/* Add example produced json */}

### Write to a Redis set 

A data structure we have yet to see in a transformation is the Set. Here is an example of a job that produces a Redis Set: 

```YAML
source:
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: set
      key:
        expression: concat(['invoices:', BillingCountry])
        language: jmespath
      args:
        member: InvoiceId
```

When writing to a set, you must supply an extra argument, `member`, which specifies the field that will be written. In this case, the result will be a Redis set with key names based on the key expression (for example, `invoices:Germany`, `invoices:USA`) 


### Write to a Redis sorted set

Similarly, you can write to a Sorted Set data structure. Here is an example: 

```YAML
source:
  server_name: chinook
  schema: public
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: sorted_set
      key:
        expression: "`invoices:sorted`"
        language: jmespath
      args:
        score: Total
        member: InvoiceId 
```

When writing to sorted sets, you must provide two additional arguments, `member` and `score`. These specify the field names that will be used as a member and a score to add an element to a sorted set. In this case, the result will be a Redis sorted set named `invoices:sorted` based on the key expression. 

Since sorted sets in Redis are inherently sorted, you can, for example, easily get the top N invoices by total invoice amount using the command below (the range `0..9` gets the top 10 invoices):

```bash
ZREVRANGE invoices:sorted 0 9 WITHSCORES
```

### Write to a Redis stream

RDI also allows you to convert the data to a Redis Stream. Here is an example: 

```YAML
source:
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: stream
      key:
        expression: "`invoice:events`"
        language: jmespath
      mapping:
        - InvoiceId: message_id
        - BillingCountry: country
        - Total
```

When writing to streams, you can use the optional parameter `mapping` to limit the number of fields sent in a message and to provide aliases for them. If you don't use the mapping parameter, all fields captured in the source will be passed as the message payload.

Note that streams are different from other data structures because existing messages are never updated or deleted. Any operation in the source will generate a new message with the corresponding operation code (`op_code field`) that is automatically added to the message payload.

In this case, the result will be a Redis stream with the name based on the key expression (for example, `invoice:events`). Only three original fields are passed in the message payload: `InvoiceId` (as `message_id`), `BillingCountry` (as `country`), `Total` (as `Total`, no alias provided) and `op_code`, which is implicitly added to all messages sent to streams.

### Write to a Redis string 

Strings are also a popular data structure to store data into. The string data type is useful for capturing a string representation of a single column from a source table. Here is an example: 

```YAML
source:
  table: album
  row_format: full
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: string
      key:
        expression: concat(['AlbumTitle:', values(key)[0]])
        language: jmespath
      args:
        value: title
```

In the example above, the `title` column is captured from the invoice table in the source. The title value is then written to the Redis target database as a string under a custom key of the form `AlbumTitle:42`, where the `42` is the primary key value of the table (the `albumid` column).

Also note that we are defining `row_format: full` since the `key` property in the defined expression wouldn't be able to be accessed otherwise.

Additionally, the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/data-pipelines/transform-examples/" target="_blank">RDI documentation</a> has examples for transformations like adding a new field, removing a field, restructuring objects, and more.
