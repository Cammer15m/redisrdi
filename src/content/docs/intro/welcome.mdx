Welcome to the Redis Data Integration (RDI) Training Lab. We are excited to help you get started with using RDI. In this lab, you will set up and run RDI using a PostgreSQL database and Redis Software. Before diving in, check out some important details below that will set your expectations for the lab.

### Lab structure
This lab is a mix of instructional sections where you will learn key concepts, and hands-on exercises. You'll notice on the left-hand menu that some sections come with one or more associated labs. These labs are denoted with a "Lab: [Title]" prefix and will have you apply the concepts you learn.

The lab is broken out into seven sections: 

1. Introduction (üìç You are here )
2. Architecture
3. Database Prep
4. Install RDI
5. Data Pipelines
6. Observability
8. Wrap Up

### Learning objectives 

By the end of this lab, you will be able to: 

- Explain what Redis Data Integration (RDI) is, its purpose, and how it operates
- Deploy RDI on a virtual machine architecture
- Configure RDI for change data capture (CDC) with a PostgreSQL source database
- Build and deploy RDI pipelines using Redis Insight
- Run, monitor, and troubleshoot an RDI deployment

### Lab environment resources

Below you'll find all the resources that come with this lab and their associated credentials (if any). Throughout this lab, you'll be using each of these resources to work with RDI. You can always return to this section if you need to quickly reopen a resource or retrieve login credentials.
