### Introduction

In this section, we will explore the architecture of RDI and how each RDI component works together to capture and store changes from a connected database. 

First, you'll need to know how RDI can be deployed. This can happen in one of two ways: Either via virtual machines or using a containerization service like Kubernetes (K8s). 

In most cases, the deployment method you choose will align with how your existing software solutions are already deployed. There's no inherent advantage to choosing one deployment method over the other, aside from the general pros and cons of virtual machines versus containerized software. All the RDI components we'll cover are available in both setups.

To start to explore these components, let's revisit the image that was introduced in the previous section, which illustrates a VM-based deployment:

We can see that the RDI architecture has three main components: 

1. A single source database
2. A RDI deployment
3. A Redis Software deployment

The above image is a good place to start to visualize the architecture, but we can go even deeper. So, let's first pry open RDI and take a peek inside:

<div class="image-center"><img src="/doc/assets/arch-step-1.svg" /></div>

Inside of RDI, we can see there are two primary components:

- **CDC collector**: This component performs a crucial step in the RDI process called *change data capture*, the main mechanism that RDI uses to sync data from a source database to the speedy Redis database. RDI currently uses an open-source collector called <a href="https://debezium.io/" target="_blank">Debezium</a> for this process.

- **Stream processor**: This component reads data from streams and applies transformations on data so they can become compatible with Redis and then passes them to the target Redis database. If you're reading the term "streams" and feeling a bit confused about where these are coming from, don't worry, we are about to explore this shortly. For now, just know this component exists and is crucial for transforming data.

If we take a look to the right of the diagram, let's now take a peek inside the Redis Software component:

Here we can also see two components:

- **RDI database**: Not to be confused with the instance of RDI itself, this database has two responsibilities:
  1. It acts as an intermediary between the **CDC collector** and the **stream processor** to pass along captured changes.
  2. It stores configuration information about the RDI instance

- **Redis target database**: Also simply known as the "target database", this is the new Redis database that will host all of the newly transformed data and will be performing the communication with any connected app

That's all for RDI Architecture, just 4 main components to identify. However, more importantly, let's now see how these components create what is known as the RDI ingestion lifecycle and move data from the source database to the Redis database.

### RDI lifecycle in action

In this lab's introduction, we briefly covered the process of how RDI works at a high level. Now, we will take that process and connect it to the architecture components to get the full picture of how it all works.

As previously mentioned, there are two phases to be familiar with when it comes to how RDI functions:

- When RDI is empty: Before RDI can start capturing changes, it must fill the target Redis database with information to capture a baseline of the data. In RDI, this process is known as *initial cache loading*.

- When RDI has a baseline dataset and is ready to capture data changes: Once RDI has a baseline it can then begin to capture new changes that occur to the source database (e.g., new writes to the database). In RDI, this process is known as *change streaming*.

Now, let's map these processes to the architecture. Here is how each of these components interact in both phases:

<Steps>
1. First, the CDC collector (Debezium) will capture specific changes from the source database. If it's the initial cache loading phase, it will capture a snapshot of the entire database.

2. Then, the collector records the captured changes using Redis streams into the RDI database inside of the Redis Software cluster.
   <div class="image-center"><img src="/doc/assets/lifecycle-2.svg" /></div>

3. Next, the streams processor reads data from the streams in the RDI database and applies any transformations that are defined.
   <div class="image-center"><img src="/doc/assets/lifecycle-3.svg" /></div>

4. Lastly, the streams processor then writes the data to the target database which can then be used by the app connected to it.

</Steps>

### Control plane

In addition to the components mentioned above, there are several additional components that keep RDI running and active. These components include:

- An operator process that schedules the CDC collector and the stream processor to implement the two phases of the pipeline lifecycle (initial cache loading and change streaming). This component will listen for state changes.
- A Prometheus endpoint to supply metrics about RDI
- A REST API to control the virtual machine

### Managing RDI

You may have noticed that the REST API component shown in the diagram earlier is noted as primarily responsible for changing the state of the RDI database. This is because it is the main entry point for two tools that help manage RDI. The two tools that can quickly access RDI components and perform actions are the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/reference/cli/" target="_blank">RDI CLI</a> and <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/tools/insight/" target="_blank">Redis Insight</a>. In this lab, we will be working with both.
