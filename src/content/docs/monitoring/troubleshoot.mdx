### What could go wrong?

Inevitably, at some point in the process of working with RDI, something might go wrong! Don't panic, RDI has a few ways to help you on your troubleshooting journey. In this section, we will cover a few different things that *might* go wrong with RDI and how to investigate them. In most cases, we will be using the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/reference/cli/" target="_blank">RDI CLI</a>, which has a variety of commands that can help debug an issue. 

#### If there is an issue during RDI installation:

There are plenty of issues that can arise when RDI is being installed on a system. This is because every system is unique and will likely have its own set of requirements to get RDI running properly. If the basic install command does not work, try running it with the DEBUG option. Like so: 

```bash
./install.sh -l DEBUG   # Installer script
redis-di install -l DEBUG    # Install command
```

Running this command should give you a clue as to what failed in the installation process. 

#### If there is an issue with the data being transformed by RDI:

In some cases, something might happen to the data that is being transferred to the target database. Recall that the RDI collector reports the data to RDI in a structured JSON format. If the structure of the JSON data is invalid or if there is a fatal bug in the transformation job, then RDI can't transform the data. When this happens, RDI will store the original data in what's called a "dead letter queue", along with a message to say why it was rejected. The dead letter queue is stored as a capped stream in the RDI metadata database. You can see the data that was rejected via the RDI CLI, by using the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/reference/cli/redis-di-get-rejected/" target="_blank">`redis-di get-rejected`</a> command. 

Additionally, if you want to know if a table failed (or rejected data) and how much of the data didn't get changed, you can see metrics on each table using Redis Insight on the RDI instance dashboard.

This is also visible via the more general <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/reference/cli/redis-di-status/" target="_blank">`redis-di status`</a> CLI command:

#### If there is an issue with the target Redis database:

If for some reason there are issues connecting or writing to a target database, RDI will keep attempting to write the changes and will also attempt to reconnect to it. While the target is disconnected, RDI will keep capturing change events from the source database and adding them to its streams in the RDI metadata database. This continues until the RDI database gets low on space to store new events. When RDI detects this, it applies a "back pressure" mechanism to capture data from the source less frequently, which reduces the risk of running out of space altogether. The systems that the source databases use to record changes can retain the change data for at least a few hours, and RDI can catch up with the changes as soon as the target connection recovers or the RDI database has more space available.


Now you should have a few tools in your debugging tool belt to know what to do when something goes wrong!
