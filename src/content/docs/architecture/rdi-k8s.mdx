This lab will be using VMs to install, run, and manage RDI. To learn more about a Kubernetes specific installation, visit the official <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/installation/install-k8s/" target="_blank">Install RDI on Kubernetes</a> documentation.

### Overview

As mentioned, RDI can also be run on a Kubernetes (K8) architecture. All of the components (e.g., collector, stream processor) we covered in the introduction are still present in this architecture. You can use the RDI Helm chart to install on Kubernetes (K8s), including Red Hat OpenShift. This creates:

- A K8s namespace named `rdi`
- Deployments for the RDI operator, metrics exporter, and API server
- A service account along with a role and role binding for the RDI operator
- A Configmap for the different components with RDI Redis database details
- Secrets with the RDI Redis database credentials and TLS certificates

The architecture looks like the following:
