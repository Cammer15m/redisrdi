More often than not, the data in a source database is normalized. This means that columns can't have composite values (such as arrays) and relationships between entities are expressed as mappings of primary keys to foreign keys between different tables (ðŸ’¡ think traditional one-to-many relationships).

Normalized data models reduce redundancy and improve data integrity for write queries but this comes at the expense of speed. However, Redis is designed to make read queries fast. This is why RDI provides the ability to denormalize relational data from a source database. The strategy that RDI offers to accomplish this goal is called *nesting*. 

By implementing nesting, RDI takes the one-to-many relationship from the source database and outputs a JSON structure where the parent object (the "one") contains the children (the "many").

For example, let's say we had a source database with two tables: "Invoice" and "Invoice Line Items". This relationship is a one-to-many where **one** invoice has **many** associated invoice line items. Here is an illustration of how this would be denormalized with RDI:

<img class="image-center" src="/doc/assets/denorm.svg" />

Here is a closer look at the output structure: 

```JSON title="Invoice:InvoiceId:123"
{
  ...
    InvoiceLineItems{
      1244: {...}
      1156: {...}
    }
}
```

In order to create this output, you will need to structure the RDI job in a specific way. Here is what the denormalization job would look like to produce the structure introduced above:

```yaml title="denorm-job.yml"
source:
 server_name: chinook
 schema: public
 table: InvoiceLine
output:
 - uses: redis.write
   with:
     nest:
       parent:
         table: Invoice
       parent_key: InvoiceId 
       path: $.InvoiceLineItems 
       nesting_key: InvoiceLineId 
       structure: map 
     on_update: merge 
     data_type: json 
```

Let's breakdown what is happening by reviewing the properties defined inside of the `output` section:

<Steps>

1. We start with the `nest` property. This is a required property to initiate a nesting structure for the output object. Everything below this property will help instruct RDI on what the output object should look like.

2. We then need to tell RDI what table we want as the "parent" of the output JSON. For this we have the required `parent` property which nests a required `table` property. In our example, we want the Invoice table to be the top level of the nested JSON, so we have specified `Invoice` as the value.

3. RDI also requires the name of the field in the parent table that represents its primary key. This is defined by a `parent_key` property. In our example, we put `InvoiceId` since that's the unique ID field (primary key) from the source table. This is how RDI will pull the data into a new key, where you will end up with something similar to the example output key shown earlier (`Invoice:InvoiceId:123`).

4. Then, we need to tell RDI the structure and name of the property that will store all the child data. For this, we have the `path` property which uses <a href="https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/" target="_blank">JSONPath</a> to create the mapping. The path must start with the `$` character, which denotes the document root. In our example, we are specifying that we want to place the nested child records inside of a `InvoiceLineItems` property of the parent JSON document. This can be seen in the example output: 

    ```JSON {3} ins="InvoiceLineItems" title="Invoice:InvoiceId:123"
    {
      ...
        InvoiceLineItems{
          1244: {...}
          1156: {...}
        }
    }
    ```

5. To finalize the output structure, we need to specify to RDI the name of the unique ID (primary key) field of the child entity from the source database. For this, we have the `nesting_key` property. Since we want to use the InvoiceLineItems table for our nested data, we indicate to RDI that it needs to check the `InvoiceLineId` field. This association can be seen in the example output: 

    ```JSON {4,5} ins="1244" ins="1156" title="Invoice:InvoiceId:123"
    {
      ...
        InvoiceLineItems{
          1244: {...}
          1156: {...}
        }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

There is an additional key not included in our example job called `child_key` that represents the field in the child entity that stores the unique ID (foreign key) of the parent entity. So in this case the foreign key in the InvoiceLineItems table creates the relationship between the two tables. You only need to add this attribute if the name of the child's foreign key field is different from the parent's.

Here is an illustration of the mapping of the RDI job properties to the tables using our example:

<img class="image-center" src="/doc/assets/nesting-key-ex.svg" />

In this example, the `child_key` is the same as the `parent_key`, so it's not included in the job file.

Lastly, let's wrap up the rest of the properties in the job file:

<Steps>
6. An optional `structure` property which represents the type of JSON nesting structure for the child entities. Currently, only a JSON map is supported so if you supply this attribute then the value must be `map`.

7. And lastly, when you specify `nest` in the job, you must also set the `data_type` attribute to `json` and the `on_update` attribute to `merge` in the surrounding output block. The `on_update` specifies the writing strategy. You can set this to either `replace` (the default) or `merge`. This affects the way the document is written to the target. Replacing the document will overwrite it completely, while merging will update it with the fields captured in the source, keeping the rest of the document intact.
</Steps>

<Aside>
There are two more things you should know when denormalizing data with RDI: 

1. Currently, only one level of nesting is supported for denormalization to nested JSON.
2. The parent key is always calculated using the following template:

      ```
      <nest.parent.table> : <nest.parent_key> : <nest.parent_key.value | nest.child_key.value = "">
      ```

Let's now move on to some more transformation examples!
