### Overview

In this section, we will take a look at the main configuration file for RDI. First, let's take a look at the full file, which sets up a RDI configuration where the source database stores data about employees. Don't worry, we are going to break down each section below. For now, just take a quick look over it and start to get a sense of what is included. We will dive deeper into the two main sections of the file: Sources and targets.

Take a look: 

```yaml
sources:
  mysql:
    type: cdc
    logging:
      level: info
    connection:
      type: mysql
      host: ${RDI_REDIS_HOST}
      port: 13000
      database: redislabscdc
      user: ${SOURCE_DB_USERNAME}
      password: ${SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD}
    tables:
          emp:
            snapshot_sql: "SELECT * from redislabscdc.emp WHERE empno < 1000"
            columns:
              - empno
              - fname
              - lname
            keys:
              - empno
targets:
  target:
    connection:
      type: redis
      host: localhost
      port: 12000
```

<Aside>
While the above example does show a sample configuration file, a few of the more advanced options (e.g., TLS/mTLS setup) have been excluded. For a full sample with advanced properties visit the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/data-pipelines/data-pipelines/" target="_blank">RDI pipeline official documentation</a>.

### Sources

Let's start with the sources section. As the name implies, this section of the `config.yaml` file allows us to configure the specific sources to use with RDI. Here is the sources section pulled from the full file above:

```yaml
sources:
  mysql:
    type: cdc
    connection:
      type: mysql
      host: ${RDI_REDIS_HOST}
      port: 13000
      database: redislabscdc
      user: ${SOURCE_DB_USERNAME}
      password: ${SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD}
    tables:
        emp:
          snapshot_sql: "SELECT * from redislabscdc.emp WHERE empno < 1000"
          columns:
            - empno
            - fname
            - lname
          keys:
            - empno
```

Let's go through each of the properties: 
-  **Name**: A unique name to identify the source. In the example above, we called the source `mysql` but any unique name will do
-  **Type**: The type of collector that RDI should use. Currently, CDC is the only type of collector supported
-  **Connection**: The connection details for the source database. This includes the hostname, port, schema/database-name, and database credentials
- **Tables**: The dataset to collect from the source database. This subsection specifies a couple of different properties:
  - The name of the table to query. In the above example, a table called `emp` which represents a source database's "employee" table
  - `snapshot_sql`: A query that selects the tables to include in the dataset (the default is to include all tables if you don't supply a list)
  - `columns`: A list of the columns you are interested in (the default is to include all columns if you don't supply a list)
  - `keys`: A list of columns to create a composite key if the table doesn't already have a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint

### Targets

The second section specifies properties for the target database(s) (the Redis database(s) that data is being transferred into). Here is the section again: 

```yaml
targets:
  target:
    connection:
      type: redis
      host: localhost
      port: 12000
```

The target section has the following properties to be aware of: 

- **Target name**: A unique name to identify the target. In the example above, we are using the default name RDI expects which is `target`
  <Aside>
   If no target name is specified, the default name "target" is used. This default applies when no connection is explicitly referenced in jobs or when no jobs are deployed. However, you can define multiple targets here and reference them in RDI jobs as needed.
  </Aside>
- **Connection**: The connection details for the source database. This includes the hostname, database type, port, schema/database-name, and database credentials

Now that we have covered the main configuration file, let's jump into how to write RDI jobs.
