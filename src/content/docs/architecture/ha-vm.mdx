### Overview

When running RDI on virtual machines, you can choose to deploy a highly available (HA) architecture. Doing so requires two virtual machines.

If launched in a highly available architecture, RDI will function as follows:
- The RDI operators run on both VMs and use an algorithm to decide which is the active one (the "leader").
- The collector and stream processor are active on one VM and the other is a standby to provide HA.

The leader election mechanism is based on a lock on a specific key called `rdi:ha:lock` that is locked for 60 seconds by one of the operators. It operators as follows:

- If this operator is alive, it will keep renewing the lock
- If not the second operator will obtain the lock
- The operator that doesn't have the lock should shutdown the processor and collector

The following diagram shows the highly available RDI VM configuration:
