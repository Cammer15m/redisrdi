In this section, we will install RDI onto the provided virtual machine. Let's get started.

### Install RDI

<Steps>
1. First we will need to SSH into the virtual machine. Open the <a href="http://localhost:7681/" target="_blank">terminal</a> to get started. Then, download the RDI package using the following command:
     
   ```bash
   tar -C /downloads/ -xvf /downloads/rdi-installation-${RDI_VERSION}.tar.gz
   ```

2. Next, navigate to the directory the package was downloaded into:

   ```bash
   cd /downloads/rdi_install/${RDI_VERSION}/
   ```

3. Start the install process:

   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh -l DEBUG
   ```

4. Notice we are using the `DEBUG` option in the last command (more on this later!). When prompted, answer the following questions in the terminal with the corresponding value. Press `enter/return` after each entry.

    - Please enter the RDI Redis database hostname or IP address: `172.16.22.21`

    - Please enter the RDI Redis database port: `12001`

    - Please enter the RDI Redis database username to use or press enter if you are using the default user:  Press `enter/return`

    - Please enter the RDI Redis database password to use []: `redislabs`

      <Aside>
      By default, for sensitive fields such as a password, the terminal won't display any characters as you type.
      </Aside>

    - Do you want to use TLS? [y/N]: `N`

    - Please enter the https port to expose RDI API and other K3s services [443]:  Press `enter/return`

    - **WARNING** - Custom iptables rules found.
      iptables rules have been detected. These rules may interfere with the installation. Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: `Y`

    - CoreDNS does not allow a loopback address as an upstream DNS server. You can disable the DNS resolver and try again.
      Alternatively, you can enter the IP addresses of upstream DNS servers. Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: `Y`

    - **WARNING** - DNS resolver detected.
      Please enter the IP addresses of upstream DNS servers, separated by comma: `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`
    
5. Take a quick mental break while RDI gets installed. â˜•
6. Lastly, you will be prompted to select the source database type you want to use. Use the number for **"Postgresql"**. 
7. Finally, confirm you receive a message that says **"Installation completed successfully!"**
</Steps>

All done. Remember, while this lab uses a virtual machine (VM) setup, RDI can also be installed on Kubernetes (K8s). Visit the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/installation/" target="_blank">RDI Installation documentation</a> to explore more in depth installation information on both VMs and K8s.

Next up, building RDI data pipelines.
